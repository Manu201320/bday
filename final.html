        Many more happy returns of the day, Aishuuu! I don’t know how much you mean to me... it's gonna be a decade already, and it feels like we just met yesterday. And the fact that we still made it so far after all the obstacles makes me feel we’re destined to be friends forever.

        Another year older, but don’t worry – you’re still rocking that “young at heart” vibe (and let’s be real, you’re probably still younger than some of your wisdom). 😂 You’re officially in the age group where it takes three days to recover from one night of partying, but hey, who’s counting? Definitely not me. 😜
        From all the silly adventures to the late-night talks where we solved the world’s problems (or at least tried to), I honestly can’t believe how fast the years have gone by. It feels like just yesterday we met, and now look at us – still managing to have even more ridiculous moments every time we hang out. I think the world might be a little less fun without you in it – and let’s be honest, who else would put up with my random weirdness?
        You’ve been my partner in crime, my go-to for inside jokes, and someone I can always count on. Whether it’s embarrassing moments, deep convos, or just laughing about absolutely nothing, you always know how to make life so much more fun. I’m beyond lucky to have you as a friend – even though you make me laugh until I can’t breathe and probably hurt my abs in the process. 😂
        On your special day, I hope you’re surrounded by love, cake, and all the weirdness that makes you...well, you. May your day be filled with all the things that make you happiest: snacks, laughter, and a questionable amount of caffeine. Also, let’s not forget – you can eat as much cake as you want today because, hey, it’s your birthday! 🎂💥
        Here’s to many more years of being ridiculous together, doing absolutely nothing productive, and causing chaos wherever we go. Happy birthday, my dear friend. I hope this year is even better than the last – and that’s a pretty high bar because you’re pretty awesome. Can’t wait to make more memories with you, and remember, no matter how old we get, we’ll always be the best duo around. 🙌🎉
        Love you more than pizza (and you know that’s serious). 🍕❤️
