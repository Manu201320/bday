      <p class="text-lg text-white text-center">For a decade now, we've walked this road, 
        Through laughter, tears, and stories untold. 
        From the first hello to our deepest chats, 
        Weâ€™ve shared our secrets, our triumphs, and mishaps. 
        A friendship so strong, built on trust and care, 
        In every moment, youâ€™ve always been there.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-white text-center">Weâ€™ve seen each other change, yet stay the same, 
        Our bond never faltered, it continues to flame. 
        From late-night talks to the inside jokes, 
        To the endless support when life sometimes broke. 
        Youâ€™ve been my anchor, my mirror, my guide, 
        With you by my side, thereâ€™s nothing to hide.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-white text-center">Through every high, every laugh, every tear, 
        Youâ€™ve been the one to make everything clear. 
        The years weâ€™ve spent could never define, 
        The endless memories and how youâ€™re mine. 
        No distance, no time, can ever erase 
        The smile on my face when I see your face.</p>

      <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image4" class="w-48 h-48 rounded-full mb-4 mx-auto">
      <p class="text-lg text-white text-center">A decade of moments, of joy and of pain, 
        The sunshine and showers, the loss and the gain. 
        Weâ€™ve been through it all, and here we still stand, 
        Hand in hand, heart to heart, a friendship so grand. 
        Itâ€™s not just time that has made us so true, 
        Itâ€™s the bond weâ€™ve built, and the love we grew.</p>

      <p class="text-lg text-white text-center">So hereâ€™s to us, to a decade more, 
        To laughter, to growth, to the memories we store. 
        Through thick and thin, weâ€™ve always been strong, 
        And I know weâ€™ll continue, where we belong. 
        For a best friend like you, Iâ€™m thankful each day, 
        In this journey of life, weâ€™ll always find our way.</p>
